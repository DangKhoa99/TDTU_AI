## Topic
Write a program that organizes a semester&#39;s schedule for a college or high school.<br>
Information about the schedule includes:
- Teacher and subject: what subjects the teacher can teach.
- Teacher with his/her minimum and maximum number of teaching hours per week.
- Classrooms and sessions: which classrooms are there; how many sessions per day. How
many hours for a session.
- In this term, how many classes should be organized for each subjects.

Students prepare theirselves with data sample and run the program on that data.<br>
Note that the results of the scheduling are optimal, not necessarily a result that satisfies all the constraints.<br>
The program will be highly evaluated if it has an interface that:
- well display results.
- are able to change input data.

Suggestion:<br>
Using the techniques:<br>
- Genetic Algorithm
- Constraint Satisfaction problem
- Local search
